			<h2>LESSON 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>

		</div>

		<div class="content">

				<b>What is the Web</b> - The Web is made of HTML Documents and is the basis for all web pages.<br>
					<ul>
					<li>It glues everything</li>
					<li>Contains hyper links</li>
					<li>Was invented in the early 1990's</li>
					</ul>

				<b>What are the major pieces of the Web?</b><br>
					<ul>	
					<li>You</li>
					<li>Your Computer + Browser</li>
					<li>The Internet</li>
					<li>Servers</li>
					</ul>

				<b>What is HTML?</b> - Definition: HTML or <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> forms what you see on the Web<br>
					<ul>
					<li>Text Content or what you see</li>
					<li>Markup or how it looks</li>
					<li>Contains references to other docs (images, videos, etc)</li>
					<li>Also includes Links to other pages</li>
					<li>To Test HTML, <a href="udacity.com/html_playground">this is a good site</a> to check out.</li>
					</ul>

				<b>What is HTML Markup?</b><br>
					<ul>
					<li>HTML markup is made up of <b>"tags"</b> and <b>"elements."</b></li>
					<li>The tags and the content in between the tags makes up the <b>ELEMENT</b>.</li>
					<li>Some common tags that go between &lt; and &gt; include:</li>
					</ul>

					<ol>
					<li>B tag (bold)</li>
					<li>EM tag (italics)</li>
					<li>A tag (anchor tag for making links)</li>
					<li>IMG tag (images)</li>
					<li>ALT tag (alternate text to more clearly define in words what an image is about - often used for broken requests or for the blind</li>
					<li>BR tag (break tag) which is an <b><em>INLINE</em></b> tag.</li>
					<li>P tag (paragraph tag) which is a <b><em>BLOCK</em></b> tag.</li>
					</ol>
					<br>

					<div class="notebox">
						<b>***Note***</b>: INLINE and BLOCK tags form an <em>invisible</em> box around the text/content.
					</div>

			<p>
				<b>What are HTML Attributes?</b> - HTML attributes (attr) go inside of tags to change things such as font size, color, etc.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>HTML Vocabulary:</b>
			</p>
					<b>TAG</b>:  HTML tags are contained within brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag that ends with a slash.<br>
					<b>ELEMENT</b>: Everyting within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>
					<b>ATTRIBUTE</b>: Further defining an HTML element<br>
					<b>SPAN</b>: Inline element<br>
					<b>DIV</b>: Block element<br>

				<b>Links:</b>

			<h2>LESSON 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>

		</div>

		<div class="content">

			<p>
				<b>- A Website is like a House</b>-The HTML is the structure of the home including the walls and frame, CSS is the style of the home including the color and layout, and Java Script is the interactive part of the home including remote controls, TV's, etc.' 
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>- Boxes Everywhere!</b>- Everything you see on Websites can be broken down into boxes and within those boxes, the content can be changed using HTML, CSS and Java Script. 
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>- Developer Tools (in the Browser)</b>- HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>- The "tree-like structure" of HTML</b> -
The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>- The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</b> - When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
			</p>

				<h3>What is CSS?</h3>

				<ul>
				<li><b>CSS</b> stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.</li>
				<li>Used to change the look and style of Webpages including color, text size, background, etc.</li>
				<li>An advantage of <b>CSS</b> is that by making a single change to the CSS style sheet, you can automatically make that change to every page of your site avoiding repetition.</li>
				</ul>

				<b>Some Benefits of Avoiding Repetition when Writing Code include:</b>
				<ol>
				<li>Saves Time: No need to change styles on every page of your website.
				<li>Reduces chances of coding mistakes.</li>
				<li>Easier to Manage: When making changes, you would need to change many lines of code. Using CSS allows you to make changes to entire elements or your entire website with ease.
				</ol>

				<h3>TEXT EDITORS TO USE FOR PROGRAMMING:</h3>

			<p>
				<b>- Scratchpad</b> - First write HTML here, write CSS here too inside of &lt; style &gt; tags - COPY HTML and go to Codepen...
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>- Codepen</b> - If you want to share your HTML, copy from scratchpad and bring to Codepen.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>- Google Chrome</b> - Use the Development tool to investigate HTML and test changes to CSS.
			</p>

			<div class="notebox">

					<b>***How to Share?***</b>
						<ul>
						<li>Open an account</li>
						<li>FREE Plan is fine</li>
						<li>Login, goto NEW PEN</li>
						<li>Paste into HTML box</li>
						<li>Change style at bottom</li>
						<li>Goto EDITOR, FULL PAGE, Copy/paste the URL for that page.</li>
						</ul>

			</div>

				<b>- Sublime</b> - Use this to write code that you will save write on your computer.
